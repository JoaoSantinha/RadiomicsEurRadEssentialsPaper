This set the mean intensity of the images at zero and scale the standard deviation to be equal to one. We then scale the standard deviation of the image intensities to be 100 by setting `normalizeScale` to `true`.\n","\n","The computation of some features (namely Energy, Total Energy and RMS) is affected by the existance of negative value and since we have normalized our images to have mean 0 and standard deviation of 100 we need to ensure that the majority of our normalized image intensities is equal or above 0. We can do this using the `voxelArrayShift`. We selected a value of `300`, which assuming a normal distribution of the image intensities would ensure that 99.7% of them are above 0.\n","\n","#### Memory savings\n","The `preCrop` set to `true` allows us to save some memory during feature computation (and possibly preventing errors).\n","\n","#### Feature extraction type (2D vs 3D)\n","We have a dataset where our images are anisotropic (voxel dimensions are not the same for all three axes) and, more specifically, the slice thickness is much higher than the in plane resolution. Because of this, we will perform the extraction of 2D radiomic features instead of 3D. Since our images are T2w Axial images we need to define that we wish to perform a 2D feature extraction by setting `force2D` to `true` and set the in-plane axis to `0` using `force2Ddimension` (Axial - 0, Coronal - 1, Saggital - 2).\n","\n","#### Interpolation/Resampling\n","To ensure that we are extracting radiomic feature that are comparable among different images we need to standardize the in-plane voxel dimensions. We do this by setting the `interpolator` to `sitkBSpline` and the `resampledPixelSpacing` to a chosen resolution `[0.6, 0.6, 0]` (the 0 on the third position means that we will not resample the slice thickness and only the in-plane resolution of the images will be transformed to 0.6 mm x 0.6 mm, which is ok because the features will be extracted in 2D).\n","\n","#### Resegmentation\n","The resegmentation allows the mask to be redefine to, for example, discard intensities in our mask that are outside $mean\\ \\pm\\ 3\\times std$. We can do this by setting `resegmentMode` to `sigma` and `resegmentRange` to `[-3, 3]`.\n","\n","#### Intensity discritization\n","To ensure that across images the number of bins used for the feature extraction we are between have across patients 30 to 130 performed a first feature extraction to get the `original_firstorder_Range` of our patients and we select the `binWidth` so that it is higher than 30 and lower than 130 accross all patients.\n","\n","#### Filters and Features\n","We use the `imageType` to define the types of images that from which we which to extract the radiomic features and `featureClass` to select the type of features to be extracted."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# Perform Radiomic Feature Extraction - Create the input file\n","\n","For the radiomic feature extraction we will use PyRadiomics batch mode, where we will have to provide as input `.csv` file contain 3 columns.
