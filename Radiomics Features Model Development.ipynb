They are more one way of adapting your problem. Technically: yes, you could use them, but use them with care, especially upsampling (you might end up creating unrealistic samples without noticing it) - and be aware that changing the frequency of samples of both classes to something not realistic \"in the wild\" might have negative effects on prediction performance as well. At least the final, held-out test set should reflect the real-life frequency of samples again. Bottom line: I've seen both cases where doing and not doing up-/or downsampling resulted in the better final outcomes, so this is something you might need to try out (but don't manipulate your test set(s)!).\"\n","\n","- The advantages of the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) over F1 score and accuracy in binary classification evaluation \n","> https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-019-6413-7 \n","\n","- Why Cohen’s Kappa should be avoided as performance measure in classification \n","> https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0222916\n","\n","- How to chose your classifier from a set of possible options:\n","> - Raschka S, Mirjalili V. **Python Machine Learning: Machine Learning and Deep Learning with Python, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow 2**. 2019.
